*** Robotics Final Project w/ future works *** 
This is a continuation on my Robotics Design Final project
The project was submitted on 12/13/2024 and included the following:
  -Python Code to Assign action groups and connect with the robotic arm
  -Printing to serial monitor to observe where in the code we are running and which actions groups
  -Inverse kinematics File 
  -GUI Test file that allows user to interact with arm via a GUI that increments either via slide bar or buttone incerments to oberserve movement of single motor

Since the project has been submitted great improvements were made but still far from where I would like for this to go
Updates are as follows:
  -Arduino Code that will control the process for the robotic arm
  -ESP32 to act as the microcontroller for the system
  -LCD 16x2 display to show info like options for action groups or to set values for X,Y and base rotation or whatever the user defines the groups to be
  -Five buttons with LEDS attached to them to interact with the program
  -Interactive messages thru the LCD display
  -Free Motion control with the buttons which allows user to actively move the arm in the direction they choose while pressing buttons
  -Soldered all components onto a perf board to allow for compaction of the circuit while allowing it to be more portable
  -3D printed a case to hold the circuit and to support the LCD screen in the case of accidental downward force

Currently I am working on my final Capstone for my EE Degree and will be working primarily on PLC Automation and Programming in hopes to create a new course for my University so that future students will have the ability to take a course
to further to understanding in Controls and Automation. This will also hopefully allow the progression of the course to maybe one day create a Automation Engineering Discipline within the Electrical Engineering Department.
For now the Robotic arm in this project will be on a small hold until I am able to figure out a way to integrate it into PLC designs so that a small scale automation simulation for purely educational purpose can be seen.
Future Work:
  -Use ESP32 along with sensors to act as a PLC system with the help of the OpenPLC software for the LD programming onto the microcontroller.
  -Create and solder new circuit to optimize the interaction between user and program while also simulating how a real PLC would be in the field when user interfaces with and HMI
  -implement sensors depending on the final constraints of the PLC Project

Thank you for looking through my project, feel free to ask question and I can answer to the best of my ability.
All python and arduino files will be included.
